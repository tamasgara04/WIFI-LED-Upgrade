# IR LED Stripe Upgrade with esp01 for WiFI Usage

# Disclaimer
I got the idea from [this website](https://www.hackster.io/ashish_8284/making-smart-led-strip-from-boring-ir-controller-led-strip-22b0f9), but i did not like the way he did some things. So i changed somne things

# Usage
The code is just a base, it could have a lot more functions, but it is enough for the start.
Flash the code to the esp01 module. (There are more than enough tutorials on Youtube)
Wire everything as shown on the image below.
